# Geolocation

## I am not correctly geolocated, what can I do?

If you are not correctly geolocated, you may have chosen not being geolocated when you installed the application. The first time the application requires it, it should ask if you want to be geolocated. Once you select an option, the option does not appear again unless you restore the device or uninstall and re-install the application.

::: tip Note
The accuracy of the geolocation depends on many factors. Devices might use Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS or cellular location to determine your location based on their availability. Moreover, vendor-specific location services based on crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspots and cellular towers can be used to determine the approximate location of your device.
